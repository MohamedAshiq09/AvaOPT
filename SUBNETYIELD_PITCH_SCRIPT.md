# SubnetYield Core - Pitching Script

## ðŸŽ¯ **Executive Pitch (30 seconds)**

"SubnetYield Core is the first cross-chain DeFi yield aggregator built specifically for Avalanche's subnet ecosystem. We solve the critical problem of fragmented liquidity across multiple chains by using Avalanche Warp Messaging (AWM) to automatically find and optimize yields between C-Chain and subnets. Users get up to 3-5% higher APY through our intelligent cross-chain optimization, while maintaining the security and decentralization they expect from DeFi."

## ðŸš€ **Full Pitch Presentation Script**

### **Opening Hook (1 minute)**
"Imagine you're a DeFi investor with $100,000 in WAVAX earning 5.13% APY on Aave. Meanwhile, the same token on an Avalanche subnet is earning 8.2% APY, but you don't know about it because the data is scattered across different chains. You're losing $3,070 per year simply because the information isn't aggregated.

This is the reality for millions of DeFi users today. The multi-chain future has arrived, but the tools haven't caught up."

### **Problem Statement (2 minutes)**
"The DeFi landscape is rapidly expanding across multiple chains and subnets, but this creates three critical problems:

**1. Information Fragmentation**
- Yield opportunities are scattered across dozens of chains
- Users manually check multiple platforms and protocols
- No single source of truth for cross-chain yields
- Time-consuming research leads to missed opportunities

**2. Capital Inefficiency**
- Users park funds on familiar chains earning suboptimal yields
- Cross-chain bridging is complex and risky
- Liquidity remains siloed instead of flowing to best opportunities
- Average user loses 20-40% potential yield annually

**3. Technical Barriers**
- Cross-chain interactions require deep technical knowledge
- Multiple wallet connections and bridge transactions
- High gas fees for moving assets between chains
- Security risks from using multiple protocols

The result? $2.3 billion in DeFi TVL earning suboptimal yields because users can't efficiently access cross-chain opportunities."

## ðŸŽ¯ **Elevator Pitch Variations**

### **30-Second Version**
"SubnetYield Core is the first cross-chain DeFi yield aggregator for Avalanche subnets. We use Avalanche Warp Messaging to automatically find the best yields across multiple chains, helping users earn 3-5% more on their crypto investments. Think of us as the Bloomberg Terminal for cross-chain DeFi yields."

### **60-Second Version**
"DeFi users are losing billions in potential yield because opportunities are scattered across multiple chains. SubnetYield Core solves this with the first intelligent cross-chain yield aggregator built on Avalanche's Warp Messaging technology. Our platform automatically compares yields between C-Chain and subnets, showing users exactly where to deploy their capital for maximum returns. We're already processing real transactions with yields up to 8.2% vs 5.13% on traditional platforms. With $45 billion in DeFi TVL and growing subnet adoption, we're positioned to capture a massive market opportunity."

### **2-Minute Version**
"The DeFi landscape has evolved into a multi-chain ecosystem, but users still manage their yields like it's 2020 - manually checking individual protocols and missing opportunities. SubnetYield Core changes this with the world's first intelligent cross-chain yield aggregator built specifically for Avalanche's subnet ecosystem.

Our platform uses Avalanche Warp Messaging to provide real-time yield comparison across C-Chain and all major subnets. Users see exactly where their WAVAX, USDT, or other tokens can earn the highest returns, with one-click optimization that handles all the complex cross-chain interactions automatically.

We're already live with real data showing yield differences of up to 3.78% between chains. For a user with $100,000 invested, that's an extra $3,780 per year just from better information and automation. With the subnet ecosystem growing 500% quarterly and $1.2 billion in Avalanche TVL, we're capturing a massive and rapidly expanding market.

Our revenue model is simple: we take 0.1% of the additional yield we generate for users. This aligns our incentives perfectly - we only make money when we make our users money. Join us in building the future of intelligent DeFi yield optimization."
